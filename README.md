# Powering a Brighter Future: 
Sustainable Mobile Power Pack (SMPP)

## Our Vision

In a world increasingly reliant on digital technologies, 
the ability to access power shouldn’t be a luxury—it should be accessible to all. 
The homeless communities and financially distressed families are often left in the dark, quite literally. 
We aim to change that with the Sustainable Mobile Power Pack (SMPP)—a practical, affordable, and eco-friendly solution to power needs.

## Introducing SMPP

Our SMPP is not just a device—it’s a revolution in a backpack. Seamlessly integrating 80 watts of solar cells into a backpack design, SMPP harnesses solar energy efficiently and conveniently. Whether wheeled like a suitcase or worn as a backpack, this powerhouse-on-the-go is your perfect travel companion.

Hidden beneath discrete flaps are a range of outlets: USB 3.0, 2.0, Type C, iPhone chargers, and a 110V outlet, accommodating a wide array of devices. And with a capacity to generate 325 watt-hours, the SMPP can recharge an average laptop multiple times from a single charge.

## Sustainability Meets Durability

We understand the need for durable and theft-resistant design. SMPP is built to withstand the rigors of everyday use with its sturdy steel frame housing and secure compartments for batteries and the solar charge controller. Our design philosophy prioritizes user-friendliness and safety, alongside functionality and resilience.

## Pledge and Price

We’ve done our best to make SMPP cost-effective. The production cost per unit is $555, but we’re striving to offer it to our backers for $888. This price ensures that we can sustainably continue production, improve upon the design, and grow our initiative.

## Powering Change: Our Donation Model

We want SMPP to be more than just a product—we want it to be a force for good. For every three SMPP units sold, we will donate one to a homeless community or disadvantaged family. This means your investment in SMPP will directly empower someone in need, providing them with a self-sustaining source of power that could change their life.
