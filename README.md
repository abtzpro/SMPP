# Powering a Brighter Future: 
Sustainable Mobile Power Pack (SMPP)

## Our Vision

In a world increasingly reliant on digital technologies, 
the ability to access power shouldn’t be a luxury—it should be accessible to all. 
The homeless communities and financially distressed families are often left in the dark, quite literally. 
We aim to change that with the Sustainable Mobile Power Pack (SMPP)—a practical, affordable, and eco-friendly solution to power needs.

## Introducing SMPP

Our SMPP is not just a device—it’s a revolution in a backpack. Seamlessly integrating 80 watts of solar cells into a backpack design, SMPP harnesses solar energy efficiently and conveniently. Whether wheeled like a suitcase or worn as a backpack, this powerhouse-on-the-go is your perfect travel companion.

Hidden beneath discrete flaps are a range of outlets: USB 3.0, 2.0, Type C, iPhone chargers, and a 110V outlet, accommodating a wide array of devices. And with a capacity to generate 325 watt-hours, the SMPP can recharge an average laptop multiple times from a single charge.

## Sustainability Meets Durability

We understand the need for durable and theft-resistant design. SMPP is built to withstand the rigors of everyday use with its sturdy steel frame housing and secure compartments for batteries and the solar charge controller. Our design philosophy prioritizes user-friendliness and safety, alongside functionality and resilience.

## Pledge and Price

We’ve done our best to make SMPP cost-effective. The production cost per unit is $555, but we’re striving to offer it to our backers for $888. This price ensures that we can sustainably continue production, improve upon the design, and grow our initiative.

## Powering Change: Our Donation Model

We want SMPP to be more than just a product—we want it to be a force for good. For every three SMPP units sold, we will donate one to a homeless community or disadvantaged family. This means your investment in SMPP will directly empower someone in need, providing them with a self-sustaining source of power that could change their life.

## Why Support Us?

Backing our project isn’t just about bringing a product to market—it’s about supporting a vision for a more sustainable and inclusive world. By supporting our Kickstarter, you’re standing for accessibility, sustainability, and empowerment. You’re not just helping us light up the world—one SMPP at a time—you’re becoming a part of a movement for change.

## Join Our Mission

We stand at the precipice of an exciting journey—one where technology, innovation, and social responsibility intersect. We invite you to join us on this path to illuminate lives, empower communities, and promote sustainability. Together, we can make a difference. Let’s power a brighter future, one SMPP at a time.

We are immensely grateful for your support and are thrilled to have you join us on this exciting journey towards creating a sustainable and empowered world.

## SMPP: The Technical Details

**Solar Cells:** 

The SMPP starts with 80 watts of solar cells, which are discretely sewn and wired into the fabric of the backpack. These photovoltaic cells are the primary power source for the system, and they convert sunlight directly into electricity. 

**MPPT Solar Charge Controller:** 

The solar charge controller is a critical component of the system. It ensures the solar cells and batteries are working together efficiently. The MPPT (Maximum Power Point Tracking) technology optimizes the match between the solar array (PV panels) and the battery bank. It can adapt to varying sunlight conditions to maximize the energy harvested from the solar cells.

**Batteries:**

The system utilizes four 12V 8Ah batteries, which are securely stored within the L-shaped steel frame. These batteries are responsible for storing the electricity generated by the solar cells. 

**Inverter:**

An inverter is integrated into the system to convert the DC electricity stored in the batteries into AC electricity. AC is the standard electrical current used by most household appliances and devices. 

**Output Panels:**

The SMPP is equipped with several output options to accommodate a wide variety of devices. These include USB 3.0, 2.0, Type C, iPhone chargers, and a 110V North American outlet. These output panels are hidden discretely beneath Velcro-closed flaps of GOR-TEX and polyester for a clean look and to protect them from wear and tear.

**Structural Frame:**

To provide the required durability and sturdiness, the SMPP incorporates a 1/2 inch thick hollow square steel frame shaped like a capital 'L'. This frame houses the batteries and holds them in place.

**Safety Features:**

The backpack features a safety belt buckle latch at the top for easy access and secure closure. Furthermore, an internal compartment for the batteries is lined with corrosion-resistant and heat-resistant material for added safety. 

**Efficiency and Output:**

The system operates with an 85% charging efficiency under direct sunlight, meaning it can fully charge within 5 hours in optimal conditions. The total output capacity is advertised as 325 watt-hours to account for any variability in conditions.

**Portability:**

Despite housing all these components, the backpack remains lightweight and portable. The whole setup, including the batteries and the steel frame, weighs around 25 pounds. 

By combining these components in a unique and innovative way, the SMPP delivers portable, sustainable energy solutions to those who need it the most, without compromising on functionality or design.

**Solar Cell Placement:**

The solar cells are positioned at the top and the front of the backpack. This placement is chosen considering the typical orientations when the backpack is in use, whether being worn or positioned stationary. This positioning helps optimize the amount of sunlight received throughout the day.

**Rapid Deployment Design:**

The safety belt buckle latch is designed to allow quick access to the internal components in case of an emergency or routine maintenance, without compromising on security during regular use.

**Battery Attachment:**

The batteries are secured to the L frame with bungee cords, which allow for slight movement to accommodate shock and vibration while on the move, reducing the risk of damage to the batteries.

**External Material:**

The SMPP uses a combination of GOR-TEX and polyester materials for the external construction. GOR-TEX provides excellent water resistance and durability, making the backpack suitable for outdoor use, while polyester gives the pack resilience and long-term color-fastness.

**Power Regulation and Distribution:**

The solar charge controller and the inverter work together to regulate and distribute the generated power to the various charging outlets. This process ensures safe and efficient charging of connected devices and protection of the batteries.

**Device Compatibility:**

The SMPP is designed to power a range of common devices, such as smartphones, laptops, and small appliances. This is accomplished through the variety of outlets provided, ensuring broad compatibility.

**Energy Storage and Usage:**

The pack is designed to provide an output of 325 watt-hours, allowing the storage of enough energy to charge an average laptop 4-6 times over, providing a significant amount of power for on-the-go use.

In essence, the SMPP serves as a portable, reliable, and sustainable power source for anyone who needs it, whether they're in an urban setting, in a remote area without reliable electricity, or simply on the go.

## Who We Are
Here at Hello Security LLC, We are not just a cybersecurity company and SaaS development agency, we are caring and concerned inventors and devlopers who truly want our work to help potentially better the world. 

## Who Created SMPP?
The idea of SMPP was invented by Hello Security LLC CEO Adam Rivers after work one day when he thought back to a time in his life when he too, found himself displaced, without a home or electricity. Adam hopes the SMPP backpack will provide people whom find themselves in a similar situation, the hope and light in the darkness so desperately required during tough times. He has adamantly fought to keep the production cost as low as physically possible and says he intends to keep it that way. He came up with the promotion model in order to shed a little light within disparraged communities whilst also bolstering growth and improvements of the product.
